AVENGERS RPG!

This is a game that allows you to become a superhero or super-villain
and fight other heroes/villains. Each character has 3 attributes:
    - Health points - a fixed number at the beginning of the game
    - Attack power - the number of points worth of damage your character does when attacking
    - Counter attack power - the number of points your enemy does to your character when attacking

You begin by choosing which character will be your hero, and then which your hero will fight first. When you attack, you inflict damage equal to your attack power and your enemy inflicts damage based on his counter attack power. Each time you attack, your attack power grows by the number of points in your initial attack power, but your enemy's counter attack power stays the same.

Every character can win or lose depending on the order that you fight the enemies. You will want to fight the enemy with the lowest counter attack power first, but you will not know what that is until you fight.

Have fun!

This was an exercise in using jquery to create and manipulate DOM objects. I learned a lot about using objects and ways to
manipulate html elements by using ids and classes.
